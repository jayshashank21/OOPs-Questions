        "Q.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a way to structure programs using classes and objects to model real-world entities. It focuses on:\n",
        "Class: A blueprint for creating objects.\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
        "        self.brand = brand\n",

        "\n",
        "OOP makes Python code reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2 What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of those objects.\n",
        "Example- class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
        "        self.brand = brand\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",

        "car1.drive()  \n",
        "# Output: The Toyota Corolla is driving.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (behavior) defined by its class.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",

        "Q.4  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans- Difference Between Abstraction and Encapsulation:\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "Hides implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "Focuses on what an object does.\n",
        "Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "class Shape(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def area(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "Bundles data and methods, restricting direct access to data.\n",
        "Focuses on how data is protected.\n",
        "Achieved using private attributes and getters/setters.\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "        self.__balance = balance  # Private\n",

        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") in Python are special methods surrounded by double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__). They enable objects to interact with built-in Python operations like addition, string representation, or comparison.\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
        "        self.value = value\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __add__(self, other):\n",
        "        return MyClass(self.value + other.value)\n",

        "print(obj1 + obj2)\n",
        " # Output: Value: 15\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- Inheritance in OOP:\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (called child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called parent or superclass). It promotes code reuse and creates hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Parent Class: The class being inherited from.\n",
        "Child Class: The class that inherits from the parent class.\n",
        "Code Reuse: The child class can use methods and attributes from the parent class without re-writing them.\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "# Parent class\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Child class inheriting from Animal\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create object of Dog class\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "dog.speak()  \n",
        "# Output: Woof!\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "Reusability: Child class reuses code from the parent class.\n",
        "Extensibility: Child class can override or extend the parent class's methods.\n",
        "Hierarchy: Establishes a clear relationship between classes (e.g., Dog is an Animal).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism in OOP:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave differently depending on the objectâ€™s class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Polymorphism:\n",
        "Method Overriding: A child class provides its specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "Method Overloading: Python does not support traditional method overloading, but polymorphism can still be achieved through default arguments.\n",
        "Example (Method Overriding)-\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Polymorphism in action\n",
        "animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
        "for animal in animals:\n",
        "    animal.speak()\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Benefit:\n",
        "Flexibility: Same method name can be used across different objects, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Encapsulation in Python:\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting access to certain attributes or methods, typically by using private or protected access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ways to Achieve Encapsulation:\n",
        "Private Attributes: Prefix attributes with __ to make them private.\n",
        "Getter/Setter Methods: Use methods to access or modify private attributes.\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        self.__balance += amount  # Method to modify private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance  # Method to access private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create object\n",
        "account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
        "print(account.get_balance())\n",
        "# Output: 1000\n",
        "account.deposit(500)\n",
        "print(account.get_balance())\n",
        "# Output: 1500\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Private attributes: Can't be accessed directly from outside the class (__balance).\n",
        "Getter/Setter methods: Provide controlled access to private data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Constructor in Python:\n",
        "A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "The constructor method is always named __init__.\n",
        "It allows you to initialize attributes when an object is created.\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand, model):  # Constructor\n",
        "        self.brand = brand\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create an object (constructor is automatically called)\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
        "print(my_car.brand)  \n",
        "# Output: Toyota\n",
        "print(my_car.model)  \n",
        "# Output: Corolla\n",
        "\n",
        "The __init__() constructor initializes the object's brand and model when my_car is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10 What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Class Methods in Python:\n",
        "Class methods are methods that take the class itself as the first argument, typically named cls.\n",
        "They can be called on the class itself, not just on instances (objects).\n",
        "Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods in Python:\n",
        "Static methods are methods that donâ€™t take self or cls as the first argument.\n",
        "They are used when you need a method that doesnâ€™t access or modify the class or instance state.\n",
        "Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "Example-\n",

        "Q.11 What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Method Overloading in Python:\n",
        "Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist. In Python, true method overloading is not supported, but similar behavior can be achieved using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Default Arguments: Define optional parameters.\n",
        "*args and **kwargs: Handle variable numbers of arguments.\n",
        "Example(Using Default Arguments)-\n",

        "Ans- Method Overriding in OOP:\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The child class's method overrides the parent class's method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "The method name and signature must be the same in both parent and child classes.\n",

        "Q.13 What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Property Decorator in Python:\n",
        "The @property decorator is used to create getter methods for class attributes, allowing access to them like attributes (without calling them as methods). Itâ€™s used to implement encapsulation by controlling how attributes are accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans- Significance of super() in Python:\n",
        "The super() function is used to call a method from a parent (super) class in the child class, which is essential for method overriding, especially in the context of multiple inheritance. It allows you to access inherited methods or attributes from a parent class without explicitly referencing the parent class by name.\n",

        "Ans- Polymorphism in Python with Inheritance:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name, but each can have its own implementation. When a method is called on an object, the appropriate method from the object's class is executed, even if the method is defined in the parent class.\n",

        "Ans- Method Chaining in Python OOP:\n",
        "Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line of code. This is possible when each method returns the object itself (i.e., self), allowing for sequential calls.\n",
